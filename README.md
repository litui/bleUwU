# <sub>*ble*</sub>UwU

This is, or will be, a library for controlling the LED colour on the [YOWU](https://www.yowu.com/)-SELKIRK-3G using BLE from an ESP32 Controller. This will be native code for ESP-IDF without the use of Arduino extensions.

This will be used primarily by [<sub>*nyan*</sub>OwO](https://github.com/litui/yowo) which will be a suite for interacting with the LEDs.

This library is not official.

**This is a work in Progress**
